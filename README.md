# Extreme-Gradient-Boosting-Advanced-Ensemble-Method.
What category of algorithms does XGBoost belong to?
Extreme Gradient Boosting is a tree-based algorithm, which sits under the supervised branch of Machine Learning. It can be used for both classification and regression problems.
XGBoost is a more refined and optimized version of the regular Gradient Boosting algorithm. In most cases, the results produced by these algorithms may end up being very similar. If you work with huge datasets, then Extreme Gradient Boosting should be a better choice for you. Please check my word document in this repository for more details about this algorithm formulas, concepts and paramters. 
Take into consideration that the model has its own module in python just using sklearn for the split of the dataset between train and test.
